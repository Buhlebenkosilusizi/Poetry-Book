<h1>Fix your crown</h1>
Looking back will only make you 
Stumble and fall
Wanting to know about everyone 
Will only make you lose focus
Don't let your crown fall
<br>
<br>
Talking about your plans and not implementing them
Will only make you a dreamer
 Don't let your crown fall
<br>
<br>
Competing instead of congratulating
Will only make you bitter
Don't let your crown fall
<br>
<br>
Snatching another person's 
Crown will make you look bad
Don't let your crown fall
<br>
<br>
Frowning won't make you a good Queen
Don't let your crown fall
