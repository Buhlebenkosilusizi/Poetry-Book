<h1>Pain</h1>

<body>
Just when I thought I was happy
You took away my joy
Just when I thought I was positive
You brought negativity
Just when I thought I won
You made me lose<br>
<br>
Living with you and accepting you
Has made me nothing but a coward
Hiding you you gave me depression
Facing you gave me humiliation
Talking about you made me
A laughing stock<br>
<br>
Thinking about you gave me a heart attack
You became a part of my life, you persecuted me
Until I finally accepted you<br>
<br>
Pain I felt you,until I couldnâ€™t feel you anymore
But there  is definitely one thing I know
I was born to win
Meeting you opened my eyes
The painful lessons you gave me made Me stronger
The fire you put me in made me 
Come out pure as gold<br>
<br>
Oh pain
The Weight you weighed up on me gave me
Wisdom
Humiliating me gave me understanding
Pain you gave me aim<br>
<br>
Your threaths gave me strength
Your oppression gave me freedom of expression
Your accusations gave me determination
Now I walk with my head held up high
Because I have no fear of being in pain<br>
<br>
Oh pain you tried but you failed
I had you pain to gain, to gain knowledge
Now I am wiser and stronger.
