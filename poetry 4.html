<h1>Have faith</h1>
       <i><h4>Confused I stand
             I just don't understand
             I just depend on God
<br>
             I got to have Faith
             His Word said He doesn't change
             I haven't seen Him change
<br>
            We held hands together
            We gotta have Faith
            We've got to believe in Him
<br>

         His Word is true, so I gotta have faith
      No No No God is not a man that He should lie
         His promises are yes and amen
        I got to have faith in Him
<br>
       My faith in Him makes my worries fade
                I am confident again
               Nothing can defeat me
               Oh I am victorious 
           I am more than a conqueror 
  If Christ is for me who can be against me
  Greater is He who is in me than the one who is
               <br> in the World.</h4></i>
