<h1>Imperfect but made perfect</h1>

My imperfections
Ruined my imaginations
My past haunted my present
I didn't think I was worth it
But God made me have it
<br>
<br>
My imperfections made me
Doubt my solutions
I had ideas, I knew how to do them but my imaginations told me about the complications
<br>
<br>
I wanted to try but my imaginations
Convinced me to quit before trying
I wanted to say I couldn't 
But my imagination made me say I can't.
<br>
<br>
My dream remained an idea
I talked about it and my imaginations couldn't stop telling me my dream was invalid
<br>
<br>
I witnessed other people's dreams coming through
I told myself I will work towards making my dream to be fulfilled.
When I was trying to create opportunities my imagination told me about impossibilities.
<br>
<br>
But then I reasoned with God and then the rest was history.
When the devil told me about my past, I told him about his future.
I saw impossibilities becoming possibilities
I saw imperfections becoming perfections
I saw ideas becoming a reality
My imaginations becoming my realities.
