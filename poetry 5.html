<h1>Wanderland</h1>

"You're useless"
"You're ugly"
"You don't belong here"
<br>
"You cannot do it and you never will"
"I hate you"
"You're weird, you're poor"
"Everyone is looking at you"
<br>
How can I possibly escape from this dark place
I'm in a place full of people yet I feel so alone! 
<br>
Help! Help! Anyone there?
I need your help! 
I scream I yell
I cry I speak
<br>
"They're are not listening to you" 
"She is just seeking for attention" they said.
<br>
I looked into my drawer and I saw a rat pill.
I killed myself and they cried
